# Building-Damage-Detection-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-

## Problem Statement 
After the damaged caused by hurricane lota, there are 61 fatalities and 41 people missing. For Relief Squads to reach them, it is important to quantify the buildings with damage, which is usually done by driving around and is time consuming. The task in hand is to propose a solution to identify damaged and not damaged buildings using there satellite images, a sample shown below:

Damaged: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62461730/163123873-045d3aca-3e58-4973-b362-d122cfb7ab50.png)

Undamaged: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62461730/163123664-904e5855-55ce-4103-8423-da896f5e63ae.png)

## Proposed Solution

1.) Building a CNN from scratch and provide the classification.
2.) Transfer Learning: Using a SOTA network and modifying it to provide the classification.

## Dataset 
1.) The data set consists of satellite images of buildings and areas affected by lota hurricane. The clarity of the images is low.
2.) We Augmented the data using kerasâ€™s ImageDataGenerator adding rotation, zoom, height modifications etc to the data.
